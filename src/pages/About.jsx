                  I'm Daryl Louie Onlayao, a passionate individual navigating
                  the exciting worlds of web development, web design, and
                  virtual assistance.

               <p className="text-xl mt-[30px]">
                  My journey into these fields began amidst the challenges of
                  the pandemic, where the influence of my brother, a seasoned
                  web developer, opened my eyes to the vast opportunities within
                  the digital realm. As we found ourselves confined to our
                  homes, I immersed myself in learning about web development,
                  initially out of curiosity.
               </p>
               <p className="text-xl mt-[30px]">
                  However, as time progressed, my interest blossomed into a
                  genuine passion. I was captivated by the endless possibilities
                  and the ability to create impactful digital experiences. This
                  newfound passion led me to make the bold decision to shift my
                  career focus and pursue my dreams in web development.
               </p>
               <p className="text-xl mt-[30px]">
                  Along the way, I embraced various opportunities, including
                  part-time roles as a virtual assistant, web developer, and
                  even exploring web design. Each experience has enriched my
                  skill set and provided valuable insights into the
                  interconnected nature of these fields.

               <p className="text-xl mt-[30px]">
                  Drawing upon my background in public education, I bring a
                  unique blend of communication, organization, and adaptability
                  to my work. Whether it's coding a website, designing an
                  interface, or providing virtual support, I approach each task
                  with dedication and enthusiasm.
